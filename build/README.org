* hugobuild
This is a simple [[http://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] site builder.

** Some Features
- Downloads and compiles latest version of Hugo
- Uses latest golang
- Uses latest debian to run binary

** Usage
*** Example run command
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run someregistry/hugobuild
#+END_SRC

The above command assumes that the site source directory is visible to
hugo through some sort of magic such as during a CI build process.

The site will be built in the *public* directory in the site source.
This is using the default Hugo behavior.

To mount a local directory as the site source, use something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run --mount type=bind,src=/some/path/to/site,dst=/workspace \
  someregistry/hugobuild
#+END_SRC

The hugo binary at */go/bin/hugo*.  The PATH includes /go/bin, so it's
possible to execute hugo without the whole path.

*** Default run command
The Dockerfile specifies:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
ENV SRCPATH /workspace
ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "-c", "hugo -s $SRCPATH"]
#+END_SRC

This simply launches hugo and specifies a source directory to build in.

*** Options
The default source directory is */workspace*. This can be overridden
when running the container by overrideing the environment variable
*SRCPATH*.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run -e SRCPATH=/some/other/path someregistry/hugobuild
#+END_SRC

Any extra arguments to be passed to hugo can be placed at the end of
the run command.  For instance, to hugo in verbose mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker run someregistry/hugobuild --verbose
#+END_SRC
